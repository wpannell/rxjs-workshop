    1. Use `addBall` and a merging strategy to add an animated ball to the svg element
       for each click of the `drop` button as soon as the `drop` button is clicked.
    2. Increment the value displayed in `dropped` for each ball dropped.
    3. Increment the value displayed in `completed` for each ball animation completed

    TODO: part 2
    4. Change merging strategies so only one animated ball is added at a time,
       But all requested balls complete their animation. Effectively, you'll be
       queueing up animations for each click to `drop`.

    TODO: part3
    5. Change merging strategies so only one animated ball may be added at a time,
       and subsequent requests cancel the currently animating ball.

    TODO: BONUS - Try different source other than button clicks to start your
                  Ball animations!

    NOTE: Balls can be added with the `addBall` function found in global scope.

    `addBall` API:

    addBall(svg: SVGElement): Observable<BallAnimationEvent>

      - returns an Observable that adds a bouncing SVGCircleElement to the passed
        SVGElement. The values emitted are BallAnimationEvents such that:

        interface BallAnimationEvent {
          t: number; // completion ratio between 0 and 1
          x: number; // x pixel position
          y: number; // y pixel position
        }
  */



  // our stream of drop clicks
}());
